Given two integers a and b. You need to find and return the count of possible ways in which we can represent the number a as the sum of unique integers raise to the power b.
For eg. if a = 10 and b = 2, only way to represent 10 as -

10 = 1^2 + 3^2 

Hence, answer is 1.
Note : x^y represents x raise to the power y
Inout Format :

Two integers a and b (separated by space)

Output Format :

Count

Constraints :
1 <= a <= 10^5
1 <= b <= 50
Sample Input 1 :

10 2

Sample Output 1 :

1

Sample Input 2 :

100 2

Sample Output 2 :

3

public class Solution {

  static int allWays(int x, int n, int num)
    {
        // Base cases
        int val = (int) (x - Math.pow(num, n));
        if (val == 0)
            return 1;
        if (val < 0)
            return 0;
      if(val==x)
      {
          return 0;
      }
      
        // Consider two possibilities, num is
        // included and num is not included.
        return allWays(val, n, num + 1) +
               allWays(x, n, num + 1);
    }
      
    // Returns number of ways to express
    // x as sum of n-th power of two.
    static int allWays(int x, int n)
    {
        return allWays(x, n, 1);
    }
}
