Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.



public class Solution {

	public static int power(int x, int n) {
        if(n==0)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        return x*power(x,n-1);
		
	}
}
